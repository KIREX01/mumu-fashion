## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please email us at [kiregeyafrancis@gmail.com](mailto:kiregeyafrancis@gmail.com) or contact us via WhatsApp at +256750783846.

We aim to acknowledge all vulnerability reports within 2 business days. After triage, we will keep you informed about the progress and expected timelines. If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix and notify you when it is released. If the report is declined, we will provide a clear explanation.
